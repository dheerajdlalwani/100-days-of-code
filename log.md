# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started with JavaScript. Learnt about variables, data-types etc.

**Thoughts:** In the beginning, this feels very boring. Because I have experience with other programming languages this really felt as if I was repeating but I know for some reason that it was necessary.
